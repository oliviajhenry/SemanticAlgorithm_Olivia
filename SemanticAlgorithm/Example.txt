Dear Diary,	Today has been one of those days where I just can't seem to shake off this overwhelming sense of fatigue.	My head feels heavy, and no amount of coffee seems to help.	It's strange because I went to bed at a reasonable hour last night, but I woke up feeling like I had barely slept at all.	I tried to push through and go about my day as usual, but even the smallest tasks felt like climbing a mountain.	My appetite has been off too; the thought of eating anything makes me feel nauseous.	I forced myself to have some toast and tea this morning, but thatâ€™s about all I could manage.	I spent most of the day lying in bed, drifting in and out of a restless sleep.	I hope this is just a bug or something that will pass soon.	It's so frustrating to feel this way, like I'm trapped in a body that won't cooperate.
